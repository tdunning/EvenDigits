## About  
A super-fast recursive processor for [OEIS A068994](https://oeis.org/A068994) cycles. It generates the most significant digit of each cycle based on the previous cycle's most significant digit. It also tracks which exponents contain (or previously contained) an odd digit.  

Cycles grow relatively slowly in height (number of least significant digits) but rapidly in width (powers of two).  

### Run  
```sh
go run cycles_recursive/processor.go
```

#### Known Issues  
- High memory usage could be mitigated by serializing data to files, which would also allow resuming from a previously resolved cycle.  
- Parallelization within a single cycle is not feasible because digits are calculated based on the previous cycle's digits and the preceding digit of the current cycle.  
- The range is hardcoded in the main function.  
- Cycle **[42](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(answer))** (spanning \(2^{42}\) to \(2^{181,898,940,354,585,647,583,007,812,541}\)) is a strong candidate for computationally proving the conjecture, based on empirical testing and its structural properties.
